                        <p>Welcome to my page! My name is Eric Arellano, I am 26 years old and have been working in the IT industry for 3 years.  
                        I attended NYU for undergrad studies, receiving a bachelors with a major in Computer science and a minor in web design. 
                        Throughout my career, I have gotten proficient in the use of much software including active directory, office365, Windows opearting 
                        systems including Windows Server, Mac OSX, Linux, and many virtualization tools.</p> 
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="col-md-12">
                        <p>I try to compensate for being a huge nerd by staying very active. Im a huge soccer fan, whether its playing it, watching it, 
                            or anything in between. You can find me this summer posted up in front of a TV yelling at it for the duration of the World Cup. I also love working out. 
                            I try to make it a habit to hit the gym at least 5 times a week, and I'll talk your ear off about routines and dieting. I was a division 1 fencer epee
                            fencer for NYU, and I try to stay involved when I can. I was also formerly the best Counter-Strike: Source player in North America, but talking about that
                            can fill up another website. </p>
